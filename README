The Client:
===================
the entry point for gettint into it ist https://sourceforge.net/p/gamewhizzards/code/ci/master/tree/client/Assets/_GameWhizzards/GameLogic/init.cs
using visual studio's "go to definition" feature, it will be easy to take a peak into the different aspects of the code.
If you are interested in the networking/movement part (the "holy grail" of mmorpg development), take a look at https://sourceforge.net/p/gamewhizzards/code/ci/master/tree/client/Assets/_GameWhizzards/GameLogic/PlayersAndEnemys/GlobalPositionsUpdate.cs
The clientside prediction (which ist basically time dependant vector interpolation in 3d-space) is beginning at line 40.

The state machine, which syncs character states with animations and audio, can be found at https://sourceforge.net/p/gamewhizzards/code/ci/master/tree/client/Assets/_GameWhizzards/GameLogic/Tools/StateMachine.cs (quite quirky atm)

The Server:
===================
The Server can be found at https://sourceforge.net/p/gamewhizzards/code/ci/master/tree/core_server/
There are two projects, core_server and LoginServer. core_server ist the instance server. LoginServer is the main server.
Just browse through it, it has still got to be refactored.

The World Editor:
===================
The world editor is at https://sourceforge.net/p/gamewhizzards/code/ci/master/tree/WorldEditor/
It is not working yet.
